You may have heard the term **JAMStack** being thrown around a lot recently in web development circles.

[JAMStack](https://jamstack.org) (JAM standing for Javascript, APIs &amp; Markup) is a set of principles about how to develop web applications.

In my opinion, the defining features of **JAMStack** can be summarised as follows...

1. Statically render your markup
2. Use client-side fetching to make your site dynamic
3. Decouple your backend from your frontend

These ideas have been championed by _cool_, developer-tooling companies such as [Netlify](https://netlify.com) (whose founders coined the term), [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and a whole bunch of other companies developing tools that empower the stack. For example, companies providing CMS products like [Sanity](https://sanity.io), [Contentful](https://contentful.com) &amp; [Prismic](https://prismic.io).

## JAMStack isn't that new

Chances are, if you're a developer with a static blog, then you're already using **JAMStack**. Congratulations. Welcome to the club!

## JAMStack is being _sold_ to developers

The main way this new approach is being pushed forward is by capturing the attention of developers. Of course, these ideas wouldn't mean much to non-developers anyway.

This has lead to what I would say is the **biggest misconception about JAMStack**, and that is... "JAMStack is about Developer Experience".

## JAMStack Is Not About Developer Experience

Don't get me wrong. The developer tooling associated with the **JAMStack** revolution is well built and exciting.

Separating a messy backend from the frontend can be incredibly empowering for frontend developers. Having full decision-making control over the frontend without being constrained by choices made on the backend can be hugely impactful. Often this leads to more considered and accessible web experiences with an additional performance boost too.

But **JAMStack** is more than just having a few nice coding sessions.

One of the down sides to **JAMStack** is that there can be so many decisions to make. What framework? Which tools? Which service?

There are more traditional approaches to web development, that don't require you to make so many decisions. For many developers, this alone is a good enough reason to stick to their well-worn, well-tested tools.

**Developer experience** is subjective.

## Pushing it to the edge

I would argue that **JAMStack** is actually more of a push towards developing web applications that can take full advantage of improvements in cloud technology.

**JAMStack** apps were born to be served on [CDNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network).

**CDNs** are cloud networks that can serve your content from "edge nodes" in regions all around the world. The advantages of using a **CDN**, as oppose to having a single server _somewhere_ in the world, which will probably fall over at some point, is that your application can be **highly available** &amp; **fast** to serve.

- **Highly available** because if one region goes down, users will just be served up content from the next closest region.

- **Fast** because CDNs are optimised for fast content delivery, wherever you are in the world.

## This is how the world works now

The development of this kind of technology is based on the fact that, _this is how the world works now_. The nature of the internet is that your customers or users can be anywhere. Therefore, it is important to make sure that, irrespective of where your users are, they will always recieve the best service.

But, this doesn't matter to all businesses. **JAMStack** doesn't always make sense either.

## JAMStack doesn't always make sense

Whether you're building internal tools for your company or you just prefer the tried and tested path, you can always make a good argument for not choosing the **JAMStack** way. That's cool.

I believe, however, that the easiest path to tread (for most developers) in 2020 to
build fast, simple web applications is the **JAMStack** way.

## Summary

The JAMStack ecosystem is developing quickly to make it so much easier for developers to build &amp; deploy great web applications.

Ultimately, JAMStack makes is easier to provide a great **User Experience**, and that's what it should be about.
